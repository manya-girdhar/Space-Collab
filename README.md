# Space-Collab
This is my hackathon submission for a space-themed hackathon. Space Collab provides users with a platform to showcase their scientific research and helps build a community of scientists with its aim to encourage collaboration and cooperation. This is a basic implementation of the website in 48-hours and I plan to add a chat feature in the near future.

## Technical Details
- Space Collab is a Flask application that uses Googleâ€™s Firebase realtime database to store user information. 
- Firebase authentication was used to handle passwords and user login. 
- Pyrebase, a Python wrapper handles Firebase commands in Flask. 
- Google Maps Javascript API as well as geocoding API is used for the functionality of google maps. 
- The frontend was designed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap framework.

## Trivia
This was my first experience with Firebase and my first time completing a fully functional website in 48 hours.
